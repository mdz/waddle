RFC 1112          Host Extensions for IP Multicasting        August 1989


4. HOST GROUP ADDRESSES

   Host groups are identified by class D IP addresses, i.e., those with
   "1110" as their high-order four bits.  Class E IP addresses, i.e.,
   those with "1111" as their high-order four bits, are reserved for
   future addressing modes.

   In Internet standard "dotted decimal" notation, host group addresses
   range from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.  The address 224.0.0.0 is
   guaranteed not to be assigned to any group, and 224.0.0.1 is assigned
   to the permanent group of all IP hosts (including gateways).  This is
   used to address all multicast hosts on the directly connected
   network.  There is no multicast address (or any other IP address) for
   all hosts on the total Internet.  The addresses of other well-known,
   permanent groups are to be published in "Assigned Numbers".

   Appendix II contains some background discussion of several issues
   related to host group addresses.

--------

A new proposal to IANA has also been
              submitted recently for allocating a set of addresses for
              administratively scoped multicast, the range is 239.0.0.0 to
              239.255.255.255.
